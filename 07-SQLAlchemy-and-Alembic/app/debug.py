# To run the file, run `python3 debug.py` in the app directory

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from models import (Base, Pet)

# Store code that should only run when your file is executed as a script

    #3.1 ✅ Uncomment below to create the engine.
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///pet_app.db')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    #3.2 ✅ Uncomment below to create sessions and bind to the engine.
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    #3.3 ✅ Create
    
    # Create a pet and save it to the database with 'session.add' and 'session.commit'
    
    rose = Pet(name="rose", species="cat", breed="domestic longhair", temperament="relaxed", owner_id=1)

    # session.add(rose)
    # session.commit()


    # Create multiple pets and bulk save them with  'session.bulk_save_objects' and 'session.commit'
    session.bulk_save_objects([rose, spot])
        # Note: Bulk save will not contain the id

    # Verify results by checking the db 

    #3.4 ✅ Read
        
    # Retrieve all pets with session.query
    pets = session.query(Pet)
    # Print the pets 
    print([pet for pet in pets])
    # Get all of the pet names and print them with session.query
    names = session.query(Pet.name)

    names_in_order = session.query(Pet.name).order_by(Pet.name)
    print([name for name in names_in_order])
    # Get the first pet with session.query and first

    print(first_pet)
    # Filter pet by temperament with session.query and filter 
    query_results = session.query(Pet).filter(Pet.temperament.like('%feisty%'))
    for record in query_results:
        print(record)
    #3.5 ✅ Update 
        
    # Update the first pet's name and print the updated pet info

    # Update all the pets' temperaments to 'cool' and print the pets 

    #3.6 ✅ Delete
        
    # Delete one item by querying the first pet, deleting it and committing

    # Delete all the pets with session.query and .delete
  
    # optional Break point for debugging and testing
