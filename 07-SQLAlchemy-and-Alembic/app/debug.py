# To run the file, run `python3 debug.py` in the app directory

from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Store code that should only run when your file is executed as a script

    #3.1 ✅ Uncomment below to create the engine.
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///pet_app.db')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    #3.2 ✅ Uncomment below to create sessions and bind to the engine.
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    #3.3 ✅ Create
    
    # Create a pet and save it to the database with 'session.add' and 'session.commit'
    
    # rose = Pet(name="rose", species="cat", breed="domestic longhair", temperament="relaxed", owner_id=1)
    # spot = Pet(name="spot", species="dog", breed="boxer", temperament="feisty", owner_id=2)

    # Create multiple pets and bulk save them with  'session.bulk_save_objects' and 'session.commit'

        # Note: Bulk save will not contain the id

    # Verify results by checking the db 

    #3.4 ✅ Read
        
    # Retrieve all pets with session.query

    # Print the pets 

    # Get all of the pet names and print them with session.query

    # Get all the pet names and print them in order with session.query and order_by

    # Get the first pet with session.query and first

    # Filter pet by temperament with session.query and filter 

    #3.5 ✅ Update 
        
    # Update the first pet's name and print the updated pet info

    # Update all the pets' temperaments to 'cool' and print the pets 

    #3.6 ✅ Delete
        
    # Delete one item by querying the first pet, deleting it and committing

    # Delete all the pets with session.query and .delete
  
    # optional Break point for debugging and testing
